# ML Sampling Techniques Comparison

This project evaluates the effectiveness of 5 different sampling techniques for imbalanced datasets using 5 machine learning models. The goal is to compare the performance of each technique and model combination to identify the best approach for addressing class imbalance.

### The sampling techniques used in this project are:

- Near Miss Sampling
- Random Under-Sampling
- SMOTE Sampling
- TomekLinks Sampling
- Random Over-Sampling

### The machine learning models used in this project are:

- Logistic Regression
- LGBM Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Classifier
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
